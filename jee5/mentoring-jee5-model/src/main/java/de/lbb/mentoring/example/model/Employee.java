/**
 * Requirements for a JPA-Entity from the spec:
 *
 * The entity class must be annotated with the Entity annotation or denoted in the XML descriptor as an
 * entity.
 * The entity class must have a no-arg constructor. The entity class may have other constructors as well.
 * The no-arg constructor must be public or protected.
 * The entity class must be a top-level class. An enum or interface should not be designated as an entity.
 * The entity class must not be final. No methods or persistent instance variables of the entity class may be
 * final.
 * If an entity instance is to be passed by value as a detached object (e.g., through a remote interface), the
 * entity class must implement the Serializable interface.
